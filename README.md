# neural_network
Further devloped my knowledge of vectors and dot product to understand how they wokr in the context or training a neural network.
Utilised activation functions and backpropagation algorithms to train the model allowing me to understand their features and functions.
Further developed my knowledge of Numpy.
Overall gained a better understanding of machine and deep learning which will help in my future projects.
